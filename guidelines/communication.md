# Communication Guidelines

# How to get help

- When you run into a problem, and you need to get help from another developer, you must immediately provide complete information about the problem. 
 - Provide the person with any error messages or terminal output
 - Provide the person with the complete steps to reproduce the problem on their own
 - If you are using a command line, copy and paste the text instead of taking a screenshot
 - The person you are asking for help should never have to solicit this information from you!
 - Use asciinema to demonstrate lengthy command line interactions with your peers
